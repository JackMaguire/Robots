# Intro

The goal of this project is to use reinforcement learning to teach a neural network to play
[Gnome Robots](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Robots?action=show)
(also known as "Chase", apparently).

I have played around with machine learning for a few years
but I have zero experience with reinforcement learning.
This will be an adventure!
